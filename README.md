# GitHub Issues Explorer

Welcome to GitHub Issues Explorer! This Electron application is designed to help you explore issues from GitHub repositories easily.

## Tech Stack

The GitHub Issues Explorer is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (v18.x).
  - React DOM: A package for React for handling DOM-specific methods (v18.x).
  - React Router DOM: DOM bindings for React Router (v6.x).
- **Electron**:
  - Electron: A framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (v26.x).

## App Overview

The GitHub Issues Explorer utilizes React components for its frontend, employing state management with the React Context API, using Providers and actions.

## Getting Started

To run the GitHub Issues Explorer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for the frontend by running `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend server by running `npm run start`.
5. Access the application in Electron.

# Solution Narrative

## Introduction

In the development of GitHub Issues Viewer application, I aimed to create an intuitive, fast, and reliable way to fetch and display GitHub issues for any given repository. This document outlines the architecture and design decisions I took to implement this solution. The application is built with React, leveraging a global state management approach using Context and Reducer patterns to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient data handling.

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured around key React principles and patterns, utilizing a context called `MainContext` for global state management, a reducer `GitHubReducer` for state updates, and a `MainProvider` to wrap our app's component tree. The data fetching logic is encapsulated within the `data-provider` folder, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Context and State Management

The heart of the state management strategy lies in the `MainContext` and `GitHubReducer`. This design choice was driven by the need for a simple yet powerful state management solution without the overhead of external libraries.

- **MainContext**: Serves as the global state container, making GitHub issues data accessible throughout the component tree. It provides an easy-to-use interface for components to consume and update the state as needed.
- **GitHubReducer**: Handles all state transformations in a predictable manner. It processes actions dispatched from various components, ensuring that state updates are consistent and centralized.

### Data Fetching and Management

The logic for fetching GitHub issues is abstracted away into the `data-provider` folder. This architectural decision allows us to isolate the API logic, making the codebase more modular and easier to update or replace if needed.

- **Data Provider**: Contains asynchronous functions that interact with the GitHub API to fetch issues and specific issue details. These functions are invoked by actions dispatched through the context, ensuring that all data fetching logic is encapsulated and separated from the UI logic.

### Component Structure

The application's component structure is designed to be modular and reusable. Components are designed to be functional and stateless where possible, relying on `MainContext` for state and actions. This approach not only makes components more testable but also improves their reusability across the application.

- **MainProvider**: Acts as a high-order component that wraps the entire application, providing access to the `MainContext` to all child components. This is where the `GitHubReducer` is applied, initializing our global state.
- **GitHubIssues and IssueOverview**: These components are responsible for displaying the list of issues and detailed views of a selected issue, respectively. They consume the state and actions provided by `MainContext` to fetch and display data.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I've encountered was managing and optimizing the application's performance, given the potentially large volume of data being fetched and rendered. To mitigate performance bottlenecks, I could implement memoization and lazy loading techniques for components rendering large lists of issues. Additionally, It could be optimized the data-fetching strategy to avoid unnecessary API calls, caching results where possible.

## Conclusion

The GitHub Issues Viewer application stands as a testament to the power of React combined with effective state management and data-fetching strategies. Through the use of `MainContext`, `GitHubReducer`, and a modular component structure, I have created an application that is not only performant and scalable but also maintains a clean and maintainable codebase. This solution narrative outlines the thoughtful considerations and architectural decisions that have shaped the development of this application, ensuring it meets the needs of its users efficiently and effectively.
